# brtr
brtr is a real-time ray tracing library developed as part of my 4th year honours project for the Computer Games Technology course at UWS. The library uses OpenCL to perform the ray tracing and includes a test application making use of it.
# Dependencies
The only dependencies for this library are the OpenGL Mathematics Library and the OpenCL headers (which are included as part of the project).
